			<b>[Verse 1]</b>

			Adrenaline, in my soul
			Every thought out of control
			Do it all to get them off their feet
			Crowd is here, about to blow
			Waitin' for me to start the show
			Out the curtain, lights go up, I'm home
			(Whoa!)

			<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>

			And myfather said, when I was younger
			Hard times breed better men (better men!)

			<b>[Chorus]</b>

			You took it all away, I give it all away
			Can't take my freedom
			Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
			I built my kingdom
			Now you bow to me
			You took my dreams but not my name
			You'll follow me until the end
			I am my kingdom

			<b>[Verse 2]</b>

			Lights go down, I'm ready now
			Tear this roof off for the town
			Gonna give 'em what they came to see
			Her the crowd, on their toes
			Ready for me to start the show
			Out the curtain, lights go up, I'm home
			(Whoa!)

			<b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>

			And my father said, when I was younger
			Hard times breed better men (better men!)

			<b>[Chorus]</b>

			You took it all away, I give it all away
			Can't take my freedom
			Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
			I built my kingdom
			Now you bow to me
			You took my dreams but not my name
			You'll follow me until the end
			I am my kingdom

			<b>[Bridge]</b>

			You tried to tell me what to do
			I saw the door and kicked it down
			I stepped right over and right through
			And you can never stop me now
			(Bow!) (Now!)
			I am the king, and you're the crown
			Now watch me as I take my throne
			And rule my kingdom

			<b>[Chorus]</b>

			You took it all away, I give it all away
			Can't take my freedom
			Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
			I built my kingdom
			Now you bow to me
			You took my dreams but not my name
			You'll follow me until the end
			I am my kingdom
			You took it all away, I give it all away
			Can't take my freedom
			Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
			I built my kingdom
			Now you bow to me
			You took my dreams but not my name
			You'll follow me until the end
			I am my kingdom

			<b>[Outro]</b>

			Now you bow to me
